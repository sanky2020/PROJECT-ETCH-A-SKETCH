This Project has been divided in total 6 sections, alongwith covering DOM manipulation in JS that we have learned in the last part, to begin with select either of the grid color of your choice;

1) To select any particular class/ID from the HTML Skeleton & then further referencing it via constant in JS file

2) Function to create 16X16 grid automatically via DOM when the page loads.

3) Function to generate new grid of variable size. 

4) Function to generate random colors in hex code.

5) Function for black and grey buttons when clicked should change the background color when the user hovers the mouse over any particular div.

6) Function for Reset when clicked should be able to change the grid size (max 100X100) based on userinput via prompt.
